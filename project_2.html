	<strong>
		After reading the previously assigned units, generally discuss (in 2-3 paragraphs, how the textbook reading is going). What are some of your impressions of what you have 
		learned so far?
	</strong>
	
	<p>
		Initially, I receive my textbook about a week after the first assigned units were published onto the canvas module. I had thought it no big deal, that I’d just read all three units and catch up in no time. However, this was not the case, after flipping through the pages, each chapter was filled with different sections, each section containing its own share of heavy information. I was overwhelmed at first, and I tried just reading each page and taking notes as normal, but found it wasn’t effective in helping me retain information or very efficient. Instead, I looked at each section’s objectives, and took notes on the key points. I also do the Quick check and Quick quiz questions in each lesson, which have been helping me a lot better.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The information in the text is a lot, and each piece is detailed and complex in that it has many different aspects to it. I have learned there are so much more components to technology, the physical and digital parts of it, than I had previously thought. It is interesting to read about the distinct characteristics of hardware and software each device encompasses. It is a combination of physical traits that make up the device for us to use it, and the parts within the computer that are digitalized for the computer to perform certain tasks. Devices are just a portion of the reading, in addition there are individual aspects of different hardware parts, types of software used for specific tasks, and how these all connect to the network altogether. It is really fascination, reading and being able to understand the technical language, it makes me see technology in a different way. It is so much more than what we see and use, being able to understand a little bit of the foundation to digital devices, their content, and the network has instilled a newfound appreciation for the digital tools I use so often.
	</p>
	
	<strong>
		Explain the difference in analog vs. digital.
	</strong>
	
	<p>
		Digital is data that has been converted into distinct digits such as 1’s and 0’s. Analog is when there is an infinite range of values to represent data. (Ch. 1 – pg. 17)
	</p>

	<br/>
	
	<strong>
		Briefly explain compressed data and provide an example of how this process could be 
		helpful.
	</strong>
	
	<p>
		Compressed data is recoding a file in order to make it smaller, containing fewer bits. This process is helpful to reduce file size, making more space for other material, and reducing transmission time. (Ch. 1 – pg. 24)
	</p>
	
	<strong>
		What is the binary number system? Explain why this is needed.
	</strong>
	
	<p>
		The binary number system is the way digital devices represent their data with the use of only 1’s and 0’s. It is crucial because it can represent any number with only the use of 1’s and 0’s, which allows digital devices to perform calculations quickly and accurately. (Ch. 1 – pg. 19)
	</p>
	
	<strong>
		Convert the Decimal Number 14 to Binary. The Binary number would be: __1110____
	</strong>
	
	<p>
		14/2=7 r 0
	</p>
	
	<p>
		7/2=3 r 1
	</p>
	
	<p>
		3/2=1 r 1
	</p>
	
	<p>
		½=0 r 1
	</p>
	
	<strong>
		What is system software? Provide an example.
	</strong>
	
	<p>
		System software is the computer program that helps the computer monitor itself to ensure it’s functionality. Some examples are operating systems, CPU monitors, and device drivers. IOS, Android, and Windows are also some well-known examples of system software because they are operation systems. (Ch. 2 – pg. 80)
	</p>
	
	<strong>
		What is application software? Provide an example. 
	</strong>
	
	<p>
		Application software are the computer programs in place to help people digitally carry out tasks. Some examples are word processors, audio apps, and spreadsheet software. Microsoft Word and PowerPoint are some examples of application software that I use often. (Ch. 2 – pg. 80)
	</p>
	
	<strong>
		Explain what the ASCII character set is.
	</strong>
	
	<p>
		The ASCIII character set is a type of code that uses 7 bits that represent character data. There are ASCII characters for various codes a symbol, numerals, uppercase letters, lower case letters, spaces, punctuation, etc. The ASCII character set represents this data in order to format code in a way that represents text and text files. (Ch. 1 – pg. 18)
	</p>
	
	<strong>
		Explain the storage formats for different types of digital data (character, numeric, audio 
		and video).
	</strong>
	
	<p>
		Digital data is stored in digital files that exist on a storage medium such as CD, DVD, or flash drive. Each file contains an extension that indicates the file format, the type of data that exists within the file. Numeric data is stored in the binary number system, which allows the computer to read and calculate the numbers used in arithmetic operations. Character data, also referred to as text, is an encoding format that uses codes of 7 bits to represent character data. The data are represented as 1’s and 0’ s, carried out as pulses of a current through a circuit board, and stored on CD’s or DVD’s and light and dark spots, or on disk drives as magnetized particles. (Ch. 1 – pg. 18-20) Digital audio is stored in different file formats with distinct advantages, and disadvantages. In order to store an audio file, it is sampled by an ADC to convert the sound into binary 1’s and 0’s, then it is stored as bits, compressed, and stored into audio formats such as AAC, MP3, Vorbis, WAV, and WMA. (Ch. 1 – pgs. 28-30) Video files are stored in container formats that contain the compressed video stream and the audio stream. Popular video container formats include AVI, MOV, MPEG, WebM, ASF, VOB, and Ogg Theora. (Ch. 1 – pg. 62)

			<h3>
				Comparing Hardware
			</h3>
			
			<ul>
				<li>
					There are multiple types of hardware that a digital device contains in order to function properly, each with their own task to ensure the device is running properly. RAM, Random Access Memory, is a type of computer hardware used for storage processing of information. RAM has a much faster processing speed than a hard disk and is a volatile device that stores data temporarily until the device system is shut down, when it wipes out the information that was stored in it.
				</li>
				
				<li>
					A hard disk is another computer hardware and stores data in a different way. The hard disk is either preinstalled into the CPU or can be used as an external device. Unlike RAM, the hard disk is non-volatile and stores data permanently, so it does not wipe out the information when the system is shut down. It has a large capacity to story trillions of bytes of data that can be accessed easily.  The hard disk has an electromagnetic surface in order to store data and has various rpms that determine the processing speed of the hard disk.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>
				Comparing Monitors
			</h3>
			
			<ul>
				<li>
					Monitors vary from their screen size to their purpose to ensure the best function for their use. For example, a professional design/editing monitor is accommodated for those who are in the field of visual entertainment. When designing something that will be viewed through print, or on a website, getting the right color and visuals is crucial. Therefore, a professional design monitor is helpful to ensure the best quality of work and can improve creative stamina. When choosing this a monitor it is useful to know the types of things that it can be suitable for such as performance, resolution, screen size, color accuracy, and price. The Samsung U-E590D is one of the most recommended overall for its ultra-HD vision, high 4k resolution, quick response time, and can display 64 times more color than standard monitors. Its pros include its stellar performance, free sync support, and fast pixel response. It was rated a 6.7 for mixed usage by users overall. However, it’s cons lie in that it can be a little more costly, does not include swivel adjustment, requires calibration, has a very narrow viewing angle, and limited flexibility in the stand, and is sold at a total cost of $360.
				</li>
		
				<li>
					In comparison, a gaming monitors key requirement is that it needs to be fast, in terms of refresh rate and response time. Response times are essential in determining refresh rates as they measure how fast the colors can be shifted, the fastest response time on a monitor currently being 1 millisecond! The best monitor for gaming that is suggested is the Samsung LC32GC75TQSNXZa, with it’s amazing gaming performance that most gamers look for. It has a 240 Hz refresh rate; the gaming is smooth and responsive due to its quick response time and low input tag, and a rating of 8 out of 10 for overall mixed usage. Its cons are the narrow viewing angles not suitable for sharing screen and reports of blacklight flicker with certain content, as well as it’s expensive cost of $530.

			<h3>	
				VPN
			</h3>
			
			<ul>
				<li>
					VPN, Virtual Private Network, is the opportunity to obtain a protected network connection when using public networks. A VPN can encode internet traffic and conceal online identity making it more difficult for a third party to track or steal your online data. A VPN hides the IP address of a device by letting the network redirect it into a remote server run by the VPN host, making it so that your internet service provider or other third parties cannot see your online history or the data you send and receive online. The data is run through a filter that turns it into “gibberish” to someone trying to obtain your data. VPN connection can secure encryption in your device, disguise whereabouts, give access to regional content not always available, and secure data transfer. However, there are possible downsides when using a VPN. The level of privacy, for example, is dependent on the VPN service you obtain and how trustworthy it is. One of the main aspects of VPN service is privacy, therefore, the best option would be to incorporate a no-logs policy, or a VPN is threatening and can be unsafe. In addition, using a VPN can slow down connection speed since it is directly connected to the internet. With a good quality VPN, the speed loss should be minimal, but it’s primary focus is on protection of privacy which can lead to slow download speeds. 
				</li>
				<li>
					I honestly think that a VPN could be useful for those who like to keep low profile or are very aware of the content they use, or maybe deal with confidential information. I personally don’t see an immediate reason I would need to encode a VPN and wouldn’t particularly enjoy the loss of speed in my connection. In addition, using a good quality VPN would cost money, and while free ones do exist, they seem unreliable and more harmful than helpful. I also am not aware of how much my data is being viewed, I’m aware of the risks and such of having an exposed network, but there is not much I’m worried about with my devices specifically. However, I do think it is interesting how a VPN works, jumbling the data concealing it from others who have the capabilities of viewing it. Currently, I have immediate privacy on my digital devices, such as passcodes and pins, so inputting a VPN does not seem suitable for me.
